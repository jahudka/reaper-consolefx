{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs36 d'Arpagnan Arpeggiator\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 I created d'Arpagnan because I wanted a simple-to-use, {\i predictable}, and still powerful arpeggiator, but I couldn't find anything that works and does what I need. So I rolled my own. Please beware that I put this together in an afternoon and it works {\i for me} - it may not work for you, or you might not like the way it does.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 It doesn't have a fancy step sequencer. It just takes whatever you play and makes a sequence out of it using a deterministic algorithm with only a couple of parameters. You can play it live. You can use it in the studio. You can print out the source code and make an origami. Your imagination is the limit.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Controls\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\f1 Step size} is pretty self-explanatory, I think.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\f1 Algorithm} offers four choices:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li720 \fi-360 \endash \tx360\tab {\f1 up} plays the notes from the lowest to the highest,\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li720 \fi-360 \endash \tx360\tab {\f1 down} does the mirror opposite,\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li720 \fi-360 \endash \tx360\tab {\f1 up&down} does one {\f1 up} and then one {\f1 down} (e.g. {\f1 cegCCgeccegCCgec...}), and\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li720 \fi-360 \endash \tx360\tab {\f1 up&down alt} does the same, except it deduplicates the last note of each cycle, so for example {\f1 cegCgecegCgec...}.\sa180\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\f1 Octaves} is used to add octaves above the played notes. It does exactly the same thing as if you added transposed copies of all the notes you play.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\f1 Backtrack every X steps...} & {\f1 ...by Y steps} are two controls you can use to create variations of the four base algorithms. They do exactly what they say they do: every X steps within the sequence the algorithm will go back Y steps and "play through" the Y already played steps again. So from e.g. {\f1 cegCEGC}, a setting of {\f1 X = 3} and {\f1 Y = 1} would yield {\f1 cegegCgCECEG}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\f1 Note length} can be used to make the emitted notes shorter. By default the notes are the full specified {\f1 Step size} long, but at 1/32 triplets at 180bpm stuff gets crazy sometimes and notes could overlap, and overlapping notes could cause hanging tones. Bringing note length back to 90% can be usually compensated by a slightly longer decay on the synth to sound the same while avoiding this issue.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\f1 Retrigger} allows you to choose whether to restart the sequence from the beginning when any one note is changed (ie. added or removed), or only when there's a period of silence (even if it's only a millisecond long).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\f1 Single-note playthrough} controls the arpeggiator's behaviour when only a single note is being played. Most arpeggiators will retrigger that single note in the defined step length, potentially adding octaves above or below. d'Arpagnan allows you to let the note play as is instead. This is useful in situations where you want to override what the arpeggiator is doing in that {\i one} bar without having to bounce the whole thing to MIDI - with this setting on, you can bounce just the offending bar and leave the rest of your arrange untouched.\sa180\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs36 Linked Gain Utility\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 This utility allows you to change a gain setting in multiple places in the project at once. It is primarily useful as a tool to adjust how hard you drive (part of) a processing chain without affecting the overall gain. Simply add multiple instances of the plugin across the project, adjust the Link ID and Invert gain settings to match your needs and prosper.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Changes to the Gain parameter of any instance are propagated across all instances sharing the same Link ID. The Invert gain setting is only applied locally for instances that have it enabled.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If you want to automate the Gain parameter, you should only do so for one of the instances sharing a given Link ID, otherwise things will quite possibly break in horrible ways!\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs36 Jahudka's Airwindows ConsoleFX ReaScript utilities\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 These ReaScript utilities make it easier to create and manage proper routing for the Airwindows Console plugins. As you probably know, the Channel versions of the plugins should go on individual tracks {\i post-fader}, which isn't something we can normally do in Reaper. To simulate this, we can route each of the source tracks through an auxiliary track with the Console FX on it. But managing these auxiliary tracks manually can be tedious, which is why I made these scripts.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Installation\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Available via {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://reapack.com"}}{\fldrslt{\ul
ReaPack
}}}
 - simply import the following URL:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \f1 https://github.com/jahudka/reaper-consolefx/raw/master/index.xml\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If you can't or don't want to use ReaPack, simply download the {\f1 *.lua} files in the {\f1 /FX} folder of this repository and copy them to anywhere inside your Reaper Scripts folder.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Creating Console Busses\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The #1 script in this package is {\f1 jahudka_consolefx_create_busses.lua}, or {\f1 Create Airwindows Console post-fader busses for selected tracks}, as it should be called in ReaPack. This script can be run in one of two modes: either select a single folder track, or select multiple tracks (folder and otherwise). In the first case the plugin essentially creates a routing construct which replaces the summing of the folder's child tracks; in the second case it replaces the summing of the selected tracks into the master bus.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\i For example:} Let's have the following tracks in our project:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \f1 1 Drums (folder)\line
   2 Kick\line
   3 Snare\line
   4 Hihat\line
5 Bass\line
6 Guitar\line
7 Vocals (folder)\line
   8 Main Voc\line
   9 Backing Voc\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If you select the {\f1 Drums} folder track and run this script, the project will look like this (although you might need to peruse the Track Manager to really see it):\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \f1 1 Drums (folder)\line
   2 Kick (parent send off, post-fader send to "11 [C] Kick")\line
   3 Snare (parent send off, post-fader send to "12 [C] Snare")\line
   4 Hihat (parent send off, post-fader send to "13 [C] Hihat")\line
5 Bass\line
6 Guitar\line
7 Vocals (folder)\line
   8 Main Voc\line
   9 Backing Voc\line
10 [C] DRUMS (folder, visible in MCP only, parent send off, post-fader send to "1 Drums", Console Buss effects added)\line
   11 [C] Kick (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   12 [C] Snare (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   13 [C] Hihat (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Now let's do the same to {\f1 Vocals}:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \f1 1 Drums (folder)\line
   2 Kick (parent send off, post-fader send to "11 [C] Kick")\line
   3 Snare (parent send off, post-fader send to "12 [C] Snare")\line
   4 Hihat (parent send off, post-fader send to "13 [C] Hihat")\line
5 Bass\line
6 Guitar\line
7 Vocals (folder)\line
   8 Main Voc (parent send off, post-fader send to "15 [C] Main Voc"\line
   9 Backing Voc (parent send off, post-fader send to "16 [C] Backing Voc"\line
10 [C] DRUMS (folder, visible in MCP only, parent send off, post-fader send to "1 Drums", Console Buss effects added)\line
   11 [C] Kick (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   12 [C] Snare (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   13 [C] Hihat (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
14 [C] VOCALS (folder, visible in MCP only, parent send off, post-fader send to "7 Vocals", Console Buss effects added)\line
   15 [C] Main Voc (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   16 [C] Backing Voc (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 It looks like a lot, doesn't it? Now we've replaced the summing of both the {\f1 Drums} and the {\f1 Vocals} folders. In your project you should really only see the {\f1 [C] DRUMS} and {\f1 [C] VOCALS} tracks in the mixer, otherwise everything should look mostly the same (except some routing indicators and sends). To finish things off, let's use the script's other mode to replace the master summing: select {\f1 Drums}, {\f1 Bass}, {\f1 Guitar} and {\f1 Vocals} and run the script. This is what your project should look like now:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \f1 1 Drums (folder, parent send off, post-fader send to "18 [C] Drums")\line
   2 Kick (parent send off, post-fader send to "11 [C] Kick")\line
   3 Snare (parent send off, post-fader send to "12 [C] Snare")\line
   4 Hihat (parent send off, post-fader send to "13 [C] Hihat")\line
5 Bass (parent send off, post-fader send to "19 [C] Bass")\line
6 Guitar (parent send off, post-fader send to "20 [C] Guitar")\line
7 Vocals (folder, parent send off, post-fader send to "21 [C] Vocals")\line
   8 Main Voc (parent send off, post-fader send to "15 [C] Main Voc"\line
   9 Backing Voc (parent send off, post-fader send to "16 [C] Backing Voc"\line
10 [C] DRUMS (folder, visible in MCP only, parent send off, post-fader send to "1 Drums", Console Buss effects added)\line
   11 [C] Kick (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   12 [C] Snare (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   13 [C] Hihat (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
14 [C] VOCALS (folder, visible in MCP only, parent send off, post-fader send to "7 Vocals", Console Buss effects added)\line
   15 [C] Main Voc (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   16 [C] Backing Voc (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
17 [C] MASTER (folder, visible in MCP only, Console Buss effects added)\line
   18 [C] Drums (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   19 [C] Bass (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   20 [C] Guitar (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\line
   21 [C] Vocals (hidden in both MCP and TCP, Console Channel effects added)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Note that unlike {\f1 [C] DRUMS} and {\f1 [C] VOCALS}, {\f1 [C] MASTER} doesn't have its parent send off and there is no post-fader send there - because the parent send {\i is} basically the post-fader send that we want there.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The script can add multiple types of the Console plugins when run; by default all the currently released Console types are used if you have them installed. You can edit the script file in the built-in IDE to choose which types you want to use. If more than one Console type is inserted on each track, all but the first will be set to offline. See below for a script which will allow you to switch between them easily.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs28 Important note\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 All the busses created by this script will have their names prefixed with {\f1 [C] }. The other two scripts rely on this prefix to find out which tracks they should affect, so if you change or remove the prefix, the other scripts won't work.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Switching the active Console type\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If you're using multiple Console types, it might be useful to be able to switch to a different type easily. That's what the {\f1 jahudka_consolefx_switch_type.lua} script is for (in ReaPack it should be called {\f1 Switch which Airwindows console type is active for the selected tracks}). To use it, either:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab select a single {\f1 [C]} folder track in the mixer, or\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab select any number of {\f1 [C]} tracks in the mixer, or\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa0 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab don't select any tracks at all.\sa180\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In the first case the script will affect the selected folder track and all of its children; in the second case it will affect only the selected tracks and in the last case it will affect all the {\f1 [C]} tracks in the project. The script will look within the first affected track for the first {\i offline} Console effect that is after an {\i online} Console effect; it will then set all Console instances of the same type on all the affected tracks to online and all the rest to offline. Well, effectively it will simply offline the current Console effect and online the next :-)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Note that since this script doesn't add new plugins you don't need to edit the {\f1 CONSOLE_TYPES} variable in the configuration section even if you edited it in the {\f1 jahudka_consolefx_create_busses.lua} script: the script will simply work with the plugins that are already on the track, it uses the {\f1 CONSOLE_TYPES} variable just to filter out non-Console plugins you might've added manually.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Enabling / disabling Console processing\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let's face it, we all want a simple button to toggle Console on and off, to try and see if we can {\i hear} it do anything! To that end I present you the {\f1 jahudka_consolefx_toggle_enabled.lua} script (known in the ReaPack realm as {\f1 Toggle bypass for the currently active Airwindows console type for the selected tracks}). This script works entirely similarly to {\f1 jahudka_consolefx_switch_type.lua}; indeed, were you to run {\f1 diff} on their sources, the terseness of its output would tell you just how similarly. Target track selection works the same; but instead of bringing the active Console type offline and looking for a next type to bring online, it simply toggles the bypass state of the currently active Console type.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Again, the {\f1 CONSOLE_TYPES} variable in the configuration section of the script is only used to filter out non-Console plugins, you don't need to change it if you edited {\f1 jahudka_consolefx_create_busses.lua}.\par}
